										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A concept vehicle or show vehicle is a car made to showcase new styling and/or new technology. They are often shown at motor shows to gauge customer reaction to new and radical designs which may or may not be mass-produced.</p>
<p>General Motors designer Harley Earl is generally credited with inventing the concept car, and did much to popularize it through its traveling Motorama shows of the 1950s.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nice people, nice places, great thinks to do and good coladas. Planning our trip, we had two flight options from Cape Town &#8211; either direct on Air Mauritius or via Joburg on SAA. Flying direct with Air Mauritius meant that we would leave Cape Town in the afternoon and arrive at our hotel in Mauritius past midnight.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>The island of Mauritius was first discovered by Arab sailors, at some time in the 9th century, the exact date is unknown. At that time the island was uninhabited and covered in a dense forest. The Arab sailors were not interested in settling on the island which they named <i>Dina Arobi</i> or <i>Dinarobin</i>. Diogo Fernandes Pereira, a Portuguese sailor found the island in 1505 and decided to give it the name of <i>Cerne</i>. However, the Portuguese did not settle permanently on the island either.</p>
<p>The first to colonise the island were the Dutch. They took possession of the island in 1598. The Dutch settlers landed on a bay in the south-eastern part of the island which was named<i>Warwyck Haven</i> after the commander VanWarwyck, the bay is now known as Grand Port. Mauritius also got its name during this period; the island was named after the Prince of Holland Mauritz de Nassau.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When this happens, normally I grab a coffee to help get the ideas flowing, but for the last few days in Montreal, no one’s been allowed to drink the water due to a bacteria leakage, which also means, no coffee.</p>
<p>Tiny women carry amazingly large bags, twice their eighty-pound weight. Some of the women carry babies in slings around front. A good adult picker can harvest over two hundred pounds of cherries and earn $8 a day, more than twice the Guatemalan minimum daily wage.</p>
<h4>What is creativity really?</h4>
<p>From a scientific perspective, creativity is your ability to think of something original from connections made between pre-existing ideas in your brain. These connections are controlled by neurotransmitters like adenosine, which alerts your brain when you’re running out of energy and reacts.</p>
<p>This got me wondering about coffee and beer and which one would actually help me be more creative and get work done. Hopefully, this will help you decide when it’s best to have that triple shot espresso or ice cold brew.</p>

<p>Adenosine is kind of like your brain’s battery status monitor.</p>
